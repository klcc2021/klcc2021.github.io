							<h4>Synchronous Component: Zoom</h4>
							<p>The conference will be held over Zoom with both pre-recorded and live presentations. Password-protected links to the conference Zoom meetings will be sent to registered attendees the day before. </p>

								<h5>Zoom Etiquette</h5>
								<p>We will be using the regular Zoom format to hold the conference. This means that we will need the cooperation of all attendees to help make things run smoothly.</p>
								<p>All participants will be muted upon entry to the zoom session. We ask that you keep your microphone muted during the presentation, and only unmute yourself during breaks or during the Q&A when instructed by the moderator. The moderator may mute you during a presentation if you forget to do so.</p>
								<p>It is up to you whether your camera is on, but we would like to encourage you to turn the camera on during the Q&A period, especially if you are asking a question. You might also consider adding a picture of yourself to display while your camera is off.</p>

								<h5>Live Q&A</h5>
								<p>Questions will be handled through Zoom's <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/200941109-Attendee-controls-in-a-meeting">raise hand</a> feature and the chat. If you would like to ask your question, please raise your hand. If you would like to have your question read, please type it into the chat.</p>
